Subject: Python Inheritance

Approximate Duration: 45 minutes

1. Introduction
2. Previous Knowledge
3. How Inheritance Works
4. Why and When to use
5. Examples os usage
6. Next Learning

## 1. Introduction

This session would be part of a course or module for begginer level. Different duration and other factors may influence
on the decisions on order, contents and leght os the complete course.

An example of structure of the course where this class is part of could be:

- Basic Language Syntax
- Data Types
  - Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dicts
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Object Oriented Programming
  - Classes, Objects, Methods, Intances
  - **Inheritance**
- Other features according to final goals 
- And so on....

## 2. Previous Knowledge

Classes are a fundamental building block of Python, allowing to bundle together data (attributes) and behaviour (methods).

- Declaration
- Init functions
- Intances
- Mutability

Code on `1_classes_and_objects.py`


## 3. How Inheritance Works


We already use inheritance all the time on builtin classes like `object` `int` `dict`.

Code on `2_builtins.py`

API

- Super Class
- Derived Class
- super
- overrides
- errors
- isinstance
- Polymorphism

Code on `3_inheritance.py`



## 4. Why, When, When Not to use

- Code Reuse
  > “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them. ”

- Abstraction
- Nested Inheritance


## 5. Examples os usage

- Error Classes
- Auth
- HTTP Client

Code on: `4_examples.py`


## 6. Next Learning

- Protocols
- Abstract Base Classes (abc)
- Decorators
- SOLID principles
