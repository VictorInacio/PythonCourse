Hi Victor,
“Teaching Session” task outlined:

You must prepare and present a teaching session during the interview (to be presented in Teams), this teaching session interview will be split into 2 parts: Part 1 is the Microteach/ Teaching session (explained below) and part 2) is a generic interview format; where they will be going through your CV with you, asking questions based on your experience and covering the role in full detail, this is also an opportunity for you to ask questions and clarify any areas you need clarified.

Please note the interview is likely to take up to a max of 1.5 hours, normally just 1hr.


In relation to the Teaching session, you are essentially treating the interview panel as if they were a classroom/students; you will be expected to share your screen with them whilst doing the task/ teaching seminar – the task is to create a short “Teaching Session” (45 minute of content to deliver) in a subject of the academy directors choice to present during the interview.


When preparing and delivering the teaching session, please simulate that the session is starting after a “break” where the class has previously done a portion of the lesson and are aware of the general ‘housekeeping’ content to avoid delays.


You are expected to treat the interviewers as if they were the students, these “students” have VERY LITTLE knowledge of cyber security let alone GRC, Blue Teaming, OSINT or Red Teaming, so they are looking for you to choose a topic at the entry-level, treat this as if it was the “first time these students are hearing about this topic”.


Ideally, the structure of the lesson should be in line with general teaching best practices.


When working on the presentation/topic, ensure that the topic is not the first lecture nor the last lecture of a total course (ie if a RedTeam PenTest course is 8 weeks, they expect you to deliver what you would cover in weeks 2-4).
 

You will then be asked question RE the course and how you designed it – for this role, it is CRITICAL that you demonstrate not only that you can teach at the entry-level, but also at more advanced levels and that you have knowledge and skills to develop course material/ syllabus along with being able to adapt delivery to a different type of students (as discussed on the phone).

 

For teaching and managerial roles, they are mainly assessing 2 things in this task;

1) Your ability to answer questions and explain your thinking and

2) Your ability for you to show you can teach what you know, they are assessing your ability to teach and construct/ develop a course.

For managerial roles, overall course, trainer, pedagogical and operational knowledge will / may also be assessed.
